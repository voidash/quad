The largest organisms found on Earth can be determined according to various aspects of organism size, such as: mass, volume, area, length, height, or even genome size.
 
 
 
The following is a list of the heaviest animals, which are all cetaceans. These whales also qualify, of course, as the largest living mammals. Since no scale is large enough to accommodate the huge body of a large whale, most whales have been weighed piecemeal, with several individual parts of the body weighed and then added together to ascertain the total mass of the animal.
