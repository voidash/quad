आत्मरक्षा वा सुरक्षा भनेको देश र यसका जनतालाई बाह्य देश वा आतङ्कबादबाट रक्षा गर्नु हो। To protect a country, a government forms an army, a navy, an air force र sometimes a marine corps, where people are specially trained to use weapons; together these people form a country's military. Governments spend huge sums of money every year to buy weapons र to train people to defend their countries. These trained people are called soldiers.
